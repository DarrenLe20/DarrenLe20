### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± I was first exposed to Programming and Computer Science in 2020 with Python, when I fell in love with the subject and decided to dedicate myself to a career in Development. Since then, I have become more proficient in various languages, including **Python**, **Java**, and **C**. I am also currently self-taught in Web Development, specializing in **Front-End Development** with **Javascript** and **ReactJS**.
