### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Quoc Anh Le (or Darren Le). I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Economics, with a concentration in Policy, at New York University. 

I was first exposed to Programming and Computer Science in 2020 with Python, when I fell in love with the subject and decided to dedicate myself to a career in Development. Since then, I have become more proficient at various languages, including Python, Java, and C. I am also self-taught in Web Development, specializing in Front-End Development with Javascript and ReactJS. 

ðŸ“« If you have any professional inquiries, please don't hesitate to reach me at my email: qal207@nyu.edu, or my number: (917)-325-2806.
